regression modeling using both a Random Forest regressor and a neural network with a custom loss function (PhysicsInformedLoss)
The provided script performs regression modeling using both a Random Forest regressor and a neural network with a custom loss function. Here's the steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loads a dataset from a CSV file and preprocesses it by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Model Training:

Trains a Random Forest regressor on the preprocessed data.
Constructs a neural network model with custom loss function (PhysicsInformedLoss) using TensorFlow/Keras and trains it on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluates the performance of both models using mean squared error (MSE) on a held-out test set.
Prints the MSE values for both the Random Forest and neural network models.
Visualization:

Plots a scatter plot showing the predicted vs actual values for the neural network model.
so by doing this script i wanted to build and compare the performance of two regression models - Random Forest and neural network - on a given dataset, showcasing the flexibility of both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning approaches. Additionally, i wanted to illustrate the integration of domain-specific constraints into the neural network training process through a custom loss function.
